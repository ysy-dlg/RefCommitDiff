**Rename Method Refactoring Detection**

`Rename Method` refactoring typically involves the following changes:

1. **Method Declaration Changes**: The method name within the same file is modified.  
2. **Invocation Relationship Changes**: The name of the method being invoked is updated.  
3. **Filename Changes**: Since the `.mjava` filename includes the method name, a renaming may also result in a filename change.

To detect these refactorings, the following data is essential:

1. **Change Lines**: The `commit_diff_lines_finergit` table records line-level changes, including additions (`+`) and deletions (`-`).  
2. **File Status**: The `commit_file_changes_finergit` table provides information about file statuses, such as additions, modifications, deletions, or renames.  
3. **Commit Records**: The `commits_original` table links commit timestamps and messages to the corresponding changes.

### **Detection Process**

#### **Step 1: Identify Modified or Renamed Files**  
Query the `commit_file_changes_finergit` table for files with a status of `M` (modified) or `Rxx` (renamed) to narrow down the potential scope of refactoring.

---

#### **Step 2: Match Method Name Changes Within the Same Commit**  
Extract method declaration changes using `DECLAREDMETHODNAME` tokens. Compare added (`+`) and deleted (`-`) method names within the same commit to identify potential renaming.

---

#### **Step 3: Validate Invocation Changes**  
Check if method invocation changes, recorded as `INVOKEDMETHODNAME` tokens, align with the identified renaming. This step ensures that method invocation names transition consistently from the old name to the new name within the same commit.

---

#### **Step 4: Aggregate Refactoring Instances**  
Compile the results into comprehensive `Rename Method` refactoring instances, including:
- **Commit ID** (`commit_id`)  
- **Old and New Method Names**  
- **Affected File Names**  
- **Invocation Relationship Changes**
