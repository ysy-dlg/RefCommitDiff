Rename Method refactoring typically involves the following changes:

1. **Method Declaration Changes**: The method name within the same file is modified.  
2. **Invocation Relationship Changes**: The name of the method being called is changed.  
3. **Filename Changes**: The method name is embedded in the `.mjava` filename, so the filename may also change.


To detect these refactorings, we need to utilize the following data:

1. **Change Lines**: The `commit_diff_lines_finergit` table records information about each line of change, including `+` for additions and `-` for deletions.  
2. **File Status**: The `commit_file_changes_finergit` table records the status of files, such as additions, modifications, deletions, or renames.  
3. **Commit Records**: The `commits_original` table (or related tables) associates commit timestamps and commit messages with the changes.

**Detection Process**

**Step 1: Identify Modified or Renamed Files**  
Use the `commit_file_changes_finergit` table to filter files with a status of `M` (modified) or `Rxx` (renamed), thereby determining the potential scope of changes.





**Step 2. Match Method Name Changes Within the Same Commit**
Using the changes in `DECLAREDMETHODNAME`, match added (`+`) and deleted (`-`) method names to verify if a renaming occurred.



**Step 2. Validate Changes in Invocation Relations**
Further verify whether the method invocations (`INVOKEDMETHODNAME`) reflect corresponding changes in the same commit:
- Ensure that method invocation names transition from the old name to the new name.


**Step 4. Aggregate Refactoring Instances**
Consolidate the results to represent `Rename Method` refactoring instances, including:
- `commit_id`
- Old and new method names
- Affected file names
- Changes in invocation relationships
