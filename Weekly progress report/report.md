### Done
- Time spent on this project this week (30h)
- Identifying Potential Refactoring Commits (mbassador)
  1. Use `is_code_file_modified = 1` from `mbassador_all_original_commits` to filter out commits that do not involve code file changes.
  2. Combine manual analysis and GPT-4.0 to determine potential refactoring based on commit information, file changes, and diff code, and label the possible refactoring types.
  3. Summarize the patterns of refactoring types proposed by Professor Hayashi in commits.
  4.

### To do
- The step **Combine manual analysis and GPT-4.0 to determine potential refactoring** did not yield satisfactory results.
